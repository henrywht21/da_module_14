An analysis of belly button biodiversity and the creation of a dashboard in javascript

This interactive dashboard is based on a 2012 dataset from https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/

This dashboard uses javascript to read data from a JSON and plotly to construct the bubble and bar charts for the data. the app.js file contains this information, and the index.html contains the skeleton of the website (the html is not an original construction, but rather was provided in the starter code).

Significant assistance in the construction of this dashboard was provided through the office hours support of Instructor Alexander Booth.
